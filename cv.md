# About Me
* I have been freelancing for about two years now. I work with builders like wordpress, prestashop and similar. I also use bootstrap, tailwindcss, but I also understand that my knowledge is not enough to work as a full-fledged front-end developer, because I don’t know and don’t understand some things. I want to learn fully Javascript, fully understand React and gain useful hands-on development experience. I would also like to find friends from the development field and find a good job
* **My strengths:**

    * Quick learner
    * Full immersion in the essence of the problems
    * Diligence
    * Team playing

# Skills

* HTML
* CSS (Bootstrap, SASS/SCSS, BEM, TailwindCSS)
* JavaScript (Fundamentals, ES6+, DOM, JSON, Asynchronous JavaScript)
* Git/GitHub

# Code Examples

```
if (localStorage.theme === 'dark' || (!('theme' in localStorage) && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches)) {
    document.documentElement.classList.add('dark')
  } else {
    document.documentElement.classList.remove('dark')
  }

  const modeBtn = document.querySelector('#mode')

  modeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    document.querySelector('html').classList.toggle('dark')

    if (document.querySelector('html').classList.contains('dark')) {
        localStorage.theme = "dark"
    } else {
        localStorage.theme = "light"
    }
  })
